Required xHTML elements (doctype, html, head, title, body)

At least two links (one relative*, one absolute)

At least two lists (one ordered, one unordered)

At least two images (one relative, one absolute)

At least one in-page anchor

At least two headers (h1, h2, h3 or otherwise)

At least two paragraphs (<p></p>), each with tag styled text (strong, em)



*The relative link does not need to link to a real webpage, you must however demonstrate the concept. Linking to example.html is fine.
