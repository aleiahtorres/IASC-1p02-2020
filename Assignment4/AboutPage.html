    <div class="AboutMe">
      <p>My name is Aleiah Torres. I have been playing volleyball for over 10 years and currently play for Brock Women's Varsity Volleyball Team. Over the years I have gained different volleyball perspectives and knowledge from multiple coaches at the club, provincial and national levels and earned many accolades along the way. My passion is to share my love for the sport to other athletes and develop their desire to become the best volleyball athlete. I believe that being an athlete means much more than how high your vertical is, or how hard you can hit a ball. The sport has taught me time management skills, communication, confidence, leadership, teamwork, how to control my emotions, addressing conflict, inclusivity, overcoming adversity and many other important life skills which are important in the real world. I have taught both indoor and beach volleyball skills/techniques and game strategies to athletes ranging from ages 8-40 years old.</p>
      <p><a class="two" href="https://legacybeach.com/">Legacy Beach</a> has allowed me to pass on my volleyball knowledge to club level athletes who have gone on to win provincial and national titles. Currently I coach athletes through <a class="two" href="http://www.niagarasportandsocial.com/?mngr=true">Niagara Sport and Social's</a> youth volleyball training sessions that occur every Sunday.</p>
